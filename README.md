MLForests
=========

MLForests is a work-in-progress with the goal of being a hard-coded program for creating random forests from a Pandas dataframe. It was created to be both an exercise to refine my Python skills and a more customizable decision tree interface for statistical classification. It will be continuously updated, with the end goal of being an error-robust classifying algorithm for use in data science.

dtrees is an object class containing Tree and Node for building a decision tree, as well as Bootstrap, while mlforests contains the functions necessary to bootstrap a sample from a Pandas dataframe and construct a random forest classifier from it.
